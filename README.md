> **Context:** This standalone app was created in **2022** to evaluate how the **flutter_bloc** package behaves and performs under **concurrency** in a greenfield setup. Our team had strong BLoC experience on **Angular**, but the **Flutter** side was missing. A few weeks later we standardized on **Riverpod**, and the new architecture successfully served a **100k+ community** on **web**, **Android**, and **iOS**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Validate BLoC behavior under **rapid, concurrent events**.
- Produce a **reasonable demo** to guide the greenfield architecture decision.

---

## âœ… Outcome
We migrated new work to **Riverpod** for leaner dependency management, improved testability, and simpler composition.
